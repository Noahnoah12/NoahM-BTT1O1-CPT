<p>The skills that I have learned in business class is Ergonomics.  Ergonomics is sitting in a proper posture. The chair should be comfortable and it should be adjustable so it is at a good level so you don't have to stretch out  your hand. Also, your feet should be flat on the ground and not on your chair.</p>
