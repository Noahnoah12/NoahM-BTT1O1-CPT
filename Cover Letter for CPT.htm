<p>Dear Mr. Rogers,</P>

<p>I am writing to apply for the opening to be a  business consultant at the company.</p>


<p>I am a grade 9 student  and right now I am taking the BTT 1O1 course which is the introduction to information and  communication technology in business. In this class I learned about different skills about business  for example:</p>

<p>-I learned how to make spreadsheets on Google Sheets and to do different functions like the sum, average, min and max. Knowing how to use spreadsheets is important because you can stay organize and it is important for calulating.  </p>

<p>-Wix can be helpful to make different websites and also in Wix can be used for advertisement for different purposes.</p>

<p>-I also learned about the hardware of the computer. It is helpful to figure out how the computer works. </p>


<p>-Google Docs is good for writing documents and to share the files with other people. </p>



<p>With my experience from the class I hope that I am qualified for the job and I hope to hear from you. And I can be reached at 905- 124 - 5679.</p>


<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Noah Majarais</p>
